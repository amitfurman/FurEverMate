# FurEverMate

An interactive web application designed to streamline the cat adoption process by consolidating listings from various sources such as Let Live and SOS. By utilizing Puppeteer for web scraping and a CRUD API to manage data stored in MongoDB, FurEverMate aims to increase the exposure of less-known adoption sites, ultimately giving more cats a chance to find loving homes.
